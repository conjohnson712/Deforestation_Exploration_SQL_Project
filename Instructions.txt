Steps to Complete:

1:  Create a View called “forestation” by joining all three tables - 
    forest_area, land_area and regions in the workspace.

2:  The forest_area and land_area tables join on both country_code AND 
    year.

3:  The regions table joins these based on only country_code.

4:  In the ‘forestation’ View, include the following:
        All of the columns of the origin tables
        A new column that provides the percent of the land area that is
        designated as forest.

5:  Keep in mind that the column forest_area_sqkm in the forest_area 
    table and the land_area_sqmi in the land_area table are in different 
    units (square kilometers and square miles, respectively), so an 
    adjustment will need to be made in the calculation you write 
    (1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km).




Create a report for the executive team that explain your results 
using full sentences.

1. GLOBAL SITUATION

Instructions:

    Answering these questions will help you add information into the 
    template.
    Use these questions as guides to write SQL queries.
    Use the output from the query to answer these questions.

a.  What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 1990? 
    Please keep in mind that you can use the country record denoted as 
    “World" in the region table.

b.  What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 2016? 
    Please keep in mind that you can use the country record in the table 
    is denoted as “World.”

c.  What was the change (in sq km) in the forest area of the world from 
    1990 to 2016?

d.  What was the percent change in forest area of the world between 1990 
    and 2016?

e.  If you compare the amount of forest area lost between 1990 and 2016, 
    to which country's total area in 2016 is it closest to?









2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK

Instructions:

    Answering these questions will help you add information into the 
    template.
    Use these questions as guides to write SQL queries.

    Use the output from the query to answer these questions.

    Create a table that shows the Regions and their percent forest area 
    (sum of forest area divided by sum of land area) in 1990 and 2016. 
    (Note that 1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km).
    Based on the table you created, ....

a.  What was the percent forest of the entire world in 2016? Which region
    had the HIGHEST percent forest in 2016, and which had the LOWEST, to 
    2 decimal places?

b.  What was the percent forest of the entire world in 1990? Which region 
    had the HIGHEST percent forest in 1990, and which had the LOWEST, to 
    2 decimal places?

c.  Based on the table you created, which regions of the world DECREASED 
    in forest area from 1990 to 2016?





3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL

Instructions:

    Answering these questions will help you add information into the 
    template.
    Use these questions as guides to write SQL queries.
    Use the output from the query to answer these questions.

a.  Which 5 countries saw the largest amount decrease in forest area from 
    1990 to 2016? What was the difference in forest area for each?

b.  Which 5 countries saw the largest percent decrease in forest area 
    from 1990 to 2016? What was the percent change to 2 decimal places 
    for each?

c.  If countries were grouped by percent forestation in quartiles, which 
    group had the most countries in it in 2016?

d.  List all of the countries that were in the 4th quartile (percent 
    forest > 75%) in 2016.

e.  How many countries had a percent forestation higher than the United 
    States in 2016?
